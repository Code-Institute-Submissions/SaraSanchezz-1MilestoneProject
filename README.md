# MY PORTFOLIO #

For my first Milestone project I have decided to create my portfolio web in a way that with the time will be very easy to adjust and modify in terms of
new skills and expierience are gained during my time as a Code Institute student and profesional expirience is acquired in the future.
The way my portfolio is been designed and structured completely cuptures my essence; the colors chosen, the fonts, the images, 
they all express and discribe my persona in a way.
I felt very special during the proccess of the creation of this project , not only because was my first time developing something on my own, also
because I had to capture myself into coding.


 
## UX ##

Project Goals:
 * Present my professional profile 
 * Be able to get an intern-shift where I will be able to acquire more experience and  knowledge.
 * Find a job.

### Design Process ###

##### Strategy Plane: ####

The main goal of the website is to create a good website portfolio which will help me to access to new professional opportunities.

#### Scope Plane: ####

The features of the website were developed based on user needs. In terms of what a good portfolio should have and how should be designed to be my introduction to future employers.
 * How many pages it will have.
 * Decide if the pages will be scrollable or separate.
 * Do online researches of other people online portfolios.
 * Use Code Institute Career services documentation to be able to spot which ones are my needs when creating my portfolio and CV.

#### Skeleton Plane: #### 

At this step of the designing process I have used Balsamiq wireframes to capture my overall idea and organization of the project.
Also at this step of the process is when I had my first mentor session where I had a very constructive input and feedback from my mentor who helped me to have a different vision regarding my project.

   <img src="assets/images/wf3.png" alt="wireframe3" width="400" height="400"/>  
   <img src="assets/images/wf4.png" alt="wireframe4" width="400" height="400"/>  
   

 
#### Surface Plane: ####

At this stage of the process, I proceeded to start to design the website using Bootstrap. 
The hero image was taken from Unsplash library [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and the picture used at the resume page was made with [Bitmoji app](https://www.bitmoji.com/).
The typography used is from Google Fonts – Raleway [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
Colors used from the CSS3 palette color available at [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp)

## Features ##

The website counts with four different and independant pages , in within we can find , Home, Resume, Projects and Contact:

1. The Home page counts with a full screen landing image , an h1 with my name and straight down my "job role" to be. 
a header with a navbar and a footer. 
2. The Resume page stresses my an "about me" section , contact details, my education and my work expirience. 
3. The Project page is been designed with a Bootstrap card lay out, to organise and explain the projects I will be doing during the course
at Code Institute.
4. The Contact page is a direct link to send me an email , and again my contact details. Also counts with the same landing image background than the Home page. 
This is being thought as the cover and the back cover of a book. 

Features Left to Implement

* As soon as I have more personal projects I will be adding them with pictures and links
* I will be implementing JavaScript features when I will be able to.

Technologies Used:
 1. HTML5 : Used to create the form and the content of the web site
	te.
 2.	CSS3 : Used to style the HTML
 3. Bootstrap Frameworks: Used some components; Header , footer and the card layout. 
    Also used the grid system to make the website responsive for all size devices.
 4. Gitpod and Github to write , test and deploy my code. 
 5. JQuery The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

 * HTML   [HTML-Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
